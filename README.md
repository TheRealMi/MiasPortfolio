## Description

This website will showcase my work for potential employers to review. It will highlight my strengths and give insight to the thought processes behind my projects.I utilized HTML and advanced CSS to create this project from scratch. As this was my first website built from scratch, I learned a lot about various useful properties in CSS and how to structure my HTML effectively.
